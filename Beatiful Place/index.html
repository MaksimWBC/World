                    <h2> Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe </h2>

                    <p> Majestic beauty and power, a rumble that never stops, a million sprays that form a cloud of steam and fog, a sense of danger when you stand on the edge, and above all this greatness a dazzling rainbow - this is the picture you can see at Victoria Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in the world. </p>
                    <p> It is located on the Zambezi River, which flows on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia. It was discovered by the Englishman David Livingston, who quite rightly called the waterfall the most wonderful sight in Africa, and later gave him the name of his queen.
                    For almost its entire length, the Zambezi is a calm river, but its character changes dramatically when, quite unexpectedly, the basalt plateau along which it flows breaks down, and the river rapidly falls down from the height of the cliff, splitting into several streams. And the height there is really rather big - 108 meters, which is a lot for waterfalls of this width. Opposite the waterfall rises another basalt cliff, completely covered with tropical forest. </p>

                    <p> First of all, Shondong Cave impresses with its size. According to the data available today, the volume inside reaches 38.5 million square meters. m - a building with a height of 40 floors can easily fit here. Inside there are about 150 cave halls, some reach 200 m in height and 150 m in width. Scientists have so far been able to explore a stretch of 6.5 km. But it is already clear that Shondong is the largest cave in the world. </p>
                    <p> Looking around the Son Doong cave, here you can see the mysterious drawings made by nature itself, ancient fossils, huge stalagmites and stalactites of various shapes. There are stalagmites that resemble cacti in shape, which is why this place was nicknamed the “Cactus Garden”. And one of the stalagmites with the funny name “Hand of the Dog” is considered the highest stalagmite in the world - its height reaches 70 m. Another highlight of the cave is stone pearls. The walls of the caves are stratified under the influence of water, as a result of which large pearls form between the layers. Although they are not precious, they are of great value to scientists. </p>

Today this place is a true flower kingdom, because all kinds of plants grow here: daffodils, tulips, poppies, lilies, sakura. In May, the Japanese Hitachi Park looks like a huge sky-blue blanket, as at this time nemophiles - American forget-me-nots - bloom on the hills. This event is celebrated with the Nemophile Harmony Festival, during this period thousands of tourists come to Hitachi Seaside Park to see this amazing spectacle with their own eyes. </p>
                    <p> In early June, poppies begin to bloom - the fields turn bright red, and by July, green fluffy balls of kochia appear here. Despite its indicative “softness”, this plant is quite prickly to the touch. By September, the green kochia changes color to orange and purplish red, creating a stunning contrast against the bright blue sky. From mid-autumn, the time of flowering of cosmos begins. Together with kochia, such a tandem creates the brightest palette - everyone should see these fabulous landscapes in their lives. </p>

It was once a popular pilgrimage destination, and today crowds still gather here on the last Sunday in July to celebrate mass. A Coast Guard post was built here during World War II and is now used to investigate the birds that nest on the high cliffs. </p>
